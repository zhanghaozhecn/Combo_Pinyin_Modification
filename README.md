# Combo_Pinyin_Modification
Modification on Combo_Pinyin, based on keyboard with 2 space bars. Focus on using home row keys.
Original design by Chen Gong: https://github.com/rime/home/wiki/ComboPinyin
To use this input method, a programable keyboard with 2 space bars are suggested.
In the folder, combo_pinyin_lrow decreases left region keys and combo_pinyin_rrow decreases right region keys by using left spacebar as a input key.

lrow plan inputs initials with only 5 keys, asdf and left space bar. Left space needs to be assigned g key.
rrow plan inputs vowels mainly by the home row except I (-i) and o (only io and o). Left space needs to be assigned u key.
